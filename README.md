This is a simple little header file for C99+ that typedefs some datatypes to give them maybe
more "rusty" names. For example, types like `uint8_t` are typedef'd to simply `u8`.

There's also extra typedef names not from Rust. For example, the infamous `long long` type is now
`longer`, and `unsigned int` is just `uint`.
